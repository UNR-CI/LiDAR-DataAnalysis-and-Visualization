      <h2 class="is-bold">Purpose</h2>

      <p>
      	The LiDAR Data Visualization Tool is a highly adaptable software that creates visualizations based on a users needs. This application was developed with the sole purpose to visualize and analyze LiDAR point cloud data being collected from sensors located near street lights throughout the city of Reno, Nevada. Currently, there are two active sensors located directly outside the University of Nevada, Reno campus on the Southeast and Northwest corners of Virginia and 15th Street with plans to continue to expand the sensor network throughout the city. By visualizing and analyzing the data through the use of charts and graphs, it is our hope that the data is presented in a readable form and that useful insight can be obtained.

      <h2 class="is-bold">Guide to Use App</h2>

      <p>
        This application is designed to take input from the user in the data explorer form where the user is able to select the sensor location and statistical analysis that they wish to visualize. As it stands currently, the user is able to create a dashboard based on the count of objects within the scene. It should be noted that the detected objects is specific to objects that are moving within the scene. After the form is submitted, the user will be able to view the data visualization dashboard which will contain the data analysis charts based on the inputted values. The data visualization dashboard is presently designed to include three main charts, each of which is updated based on the near real time data stream. The first chart provides a look at the current number of objects which is broken down into two categories, those being vehicles and pedestrians. The second chart is a line graph which is continuously updated in near real time to show the total object count per second. The final visualization is a near real time 3D mesh render that shows the most recent view of what is going on at the street level. This 3D scene can be controlled through mouse and keyboard input which allows for exploration of the scene. Additionally, the Settings page includes features that adds to the customization of the visualization such as changing the color of the point cloud through a color wheel and changing the size of the points. This allows for the output to changed based on preference and to provide additional detail to the 3D scene. Through these visualizations, the main goal of this tool is to ultimately provide a quality experience that allows for quick and efficient near real time analysis of traffic patterns at any given point in time.
